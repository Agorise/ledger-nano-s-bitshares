# Some Background for getting started developing for Nano S

### Relevent Repositories

**The development SDK:** contains header and library files for compiling
Nano S applications.  Located at:
[LedgerHQ/nanos-secure-sdk](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/nanos-secure-sdk).

**Python Tools for Ledger Blue and Nano S:** These contain tools for loading
apps onto the Nano S, and basic communication between Nano S and a python
interface on the computer.  Located at:
[LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python).

**Sample Apps:** These provide examples of basic operations on the Nano S
device. Located at:
[LedgerHQ/blue-sample-apps](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-sample-apps).

### Documentation

Comprehensive developer documentation does not seem to be available yet (but
is expected).  Some very good general overview information for developers on
the way the BOLOS operating system and apps work and interact is located
here, however:
[Ledger Documentation Hub](http://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

A tutorial for building, installing, and running the Hello World sample app
is located here: (part of the docs mentioned above)
[Getting started](http://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nanos/setup.html).
It may be slightly out of date.
